    <h1>The Best Movies According to Renee</h1>
    <h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3>Lion in Winter</h3>
    <p>I love learning about the lives of real people from throughout history. This was a well crafted and superbly acted movie depicting the lives of King Henry II of England and his wife Eleanor of Aquitaine.</p>
    <h3>Avalon</h3>
    <p>As someone who has done much research into genealogy and family history, this movie was such a wonderful example of how a family changes over a few generations from the time the first generation of the family comes to America</p>
    <h3>The Burbs</h3>
    <p>The bizarre happenings in this seemingly normal neighborhood remind me of the neighborhood in which I live. The movie is classified under the categories of Comedy and Horror. That is a pretty accurate description of my neighborhood! </p>
